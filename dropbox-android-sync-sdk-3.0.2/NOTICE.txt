SQLite

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain

domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at
the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use,
compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code
form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
and by any means.
