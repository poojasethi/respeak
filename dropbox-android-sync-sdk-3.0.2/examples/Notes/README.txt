Notes Sample Application
========================

This is an example text file viewer/editor backed with the Dropbox
SyncSDK. 

The SyncSDK handles all the tricky details of caching files and
syncing changes, so this app supports creating, modifying, renaming,
and deleting notes while completely offline without any special logic
to do so!

* Pre-requisites:

Required Android API Level: 4 to run, 17 to build

This app can be built after importing into Eclipse with the ADT
plug-in.  In order to build and run this app, you must first copy the
appropriate libraries from the SDK libs/ directory to the sample app's
libs/ directory.  See the tutorial for more information.

The Android Support Library v4 is also required.  In Eclipse, from the
project context menu, run Android Tools -> Add Support Library.
